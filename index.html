ademics and practitioners have not developed a unique definition for the term "DevOps".[a][b][c][d]

From an academic perspective, Len Bass, Ingo Weber, and Liming Zhu—three computer science researchers from the CSIRO and the Software Engineering Institute—suggested defining DevOps as "a set of practices intended to reduce the time between committing a change to a system and the change being placed into normal production, while ensuring high quality".[6]

The term DevOps, however, has been used in multiple contexts.[7][unreliable source?]

In 2009, the first conference named devopsdays was held in Ghent, Belgium. The conference was founded by Belgian consultant, project manager and agile practitioner Patrick Debois.[8][who?][9] The conference has now spread to other countries.[10]

In 2012, the State of DevOps report was conceived and launched by Alanna Brown at Puppet.[11][12] As of 2014, the annual State of DevOps report was published by Nicole Forsgren, Gene Kim, Jez Humble and others.[13][14] In 2014, they found that DevOps adoption was accelerating.[13] Also in 2014, Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory wrote the book More Agile Testing, containing a chapter on testing and DevOps.[15][16]

Main article: DevOps toolchain
As DevOps is intended to be a cross-functional mode of working, those who practice the methodology use different sets of tools—referred to as "toolchains"—rather than a single one.[17] These toolchains are expected to fit into one or more of the following categories, reflective of key aspects of the development and delivery process:[18][unreliable source?][19][unreliable source?]

Coding – code development and review, source code management tools, code merging.
Building – continuous integration tools, build status.
Testing – continuous testing tools that provide quick and timely feedback on business risks.
Packaging – artifact repository, application pre-deployment staging.
Releasing – change management, release approvals, release automation.
Configuring – infrastructure configuration and management, infrastructure as code tools.
Monitoring – applications performance monitoring, end-user experience.
Some categories are more essential in a DevOps toolchain than others; especially continuous integration (e.g. Jenkins, Gitlab, Bitbucket pipelines) and infrastructure as code (e.g., Terraform, Ansible, Puppet).[20][unreliable source?][21][unreliable source?]

Forsgren et al. found that IT performance is strongly correlated with DevOps practices like source code management and continuous delivery.[13]

Relationship to other approaches
Agile
Main article: Agile software development
Agile and DevOps serve complementary roles: several standard DevOps practices such as automated build and test, continuous integration, and continuous delivery originated in the Agile world, which dates (informally) to the 1990s, and formally to 2001.[22] Agile can be viewed as addressing communication gaps between customers and developers, while DevOps addresses gaps between developers and IT operations / infrastructure.[23] Also, DevOps has focus on the deployment of developed software, whether it is developed via Agile or other methodologies.[22].

ArchOps
ArchOps presents an extension for DevOps practice, starting from software architecture artifacts, instead of source code, for operation deployment.[24]. ArchOps states that architectural models are first-class entities in software development, deployment, and operations.

TestOps
TestOps is to hardware development what DevOps is to software development. The idea is a toolchain that links design and test operations together. In the case of hardware, design means EDA tools and the CAD department, and test means electronic measurement equipment like oscilloscopes and so on.[25]

Continuous delivery
Main article: Continuous delivery
Continuous delivery and DevOps have common goals and are often used in conjunction, but there are subtle differences.[26][27]

While continuous delivery is focused on automating the processes in software delivery, DevOps also focuses on the organizational change to support great collaboration between the many functions involved.[26]

DevOps and continuous delivery share a common background in agile methods and lean thinking: small and frequent changes with focused value to the end customer.[28][unreliable source?] Lean management and continuous delivery are fundamental to delivering value faster, in a sustainable way.[14] Continuous delivery focuses on making sure the software is always in a releasable state throughout its lifecycle.[13] This makes it cheaper and less risky to deliver the software.[13]

Improved collaboration and communication both between and within organizational teams can help achieve faster time to market, with reduced risks.[29][30]

Main article: DataOps
The application of continuous delivery and DevOps to data analytics has been termed DataOps. DataOps seeks to integrate data engineering, data integration, data quality, data security, and data privacy with operations.[31][unreliable source?] It applies principles from DevOps, Agile Development and the statistical process control, used in lean manufacturing, to improve the cycle time of extracting value from data analytics.[32][unreliable source?]

Main article: Site reliability engineering
In 2003, Google developed site reliability engineering (SRE), an approach for releasing new features continuously into large-scale high-availability systems while maintaining high-quality end-user experience.[33] While SRE predates the development of DevOps, they are generally viewed as being related to each other.[34][unreliable source?]

Systems administration

DevOps is often viewed as an approach to applying systems administration work to cloud technology.[35]

WinOps
Main article: WinOps
WinOps is the term used for DevOps practices for a Microsoft-centric view.[citation needed]

Toyota production system, lean thinking, kaizen
Main article: Toyota Production System
Toyota production system, also known under the acronym TPS, was the inspiration for lean thinking with its focus on continuous improvement, kaizen, flow and small batches. The Andon cord principle to create fast feedback, swarm and solve problems stems from TPS. [36][37]

DevSecOps, Shifting Security Left
DevSecOps is an augmentation of DevOps to allow for security practices to be integrated into the DevOps approach. The traditional centralised security team model must adopt a federated model allowing each delivery team the ability to factor in the correct security controls into their DevOps practices.

Goals

IT performance can be measured in terms of throughput and stability. [13] Throughput can be measured by deployment frequency and lead time for changes; stability can be measured by mean time to recover. The State of DevOps Reports found that investing in practices that increase these throughput and stability measures increase IT performance.[13][14]

The goals of DevOps span the entire delivery pipeline. They include:[citation needed]

Improved deployment frequency;
Faster time to market;
Lower failure rate of new releases;
Shortened lead time between fixes;
Faster mean time to recovery (in the event of a new release crashing or otherwise disabling the current system).
Simple processes become increasingly programmable and dynamic, using a DevOps approach.[38][unreliable source?] DevOps aims to maximize the predictability, efficiency, security, and maintainability of operational processes.[citation needed] Very often, automation supports this objective.

DevOps integration targets product delivery, continuous testing, quality testing, feature development, and maintenance releases in order to improve reliability and security and provide faster development and deployment cycles.[citation needed] Many of the ideas (and people) involved in DevOps came from the enterprise systems management and agile software development movements.[39][unreliable source?]

Practices that correlate with deployment frequency are:[13]

Continuous delivery
Using version control for all production artifacts
Practices that correlate with a lead time for change are:[13]

Using version control for all production artifacts
Automated testing
Practices that correlate with a mean time to recovery for change are:[13]

Using version control for all production artifacts
Monitoring system and application health
Companies that practice DevOps[failed verification] have reported significant benefits, including: significantly shorter time to market, improved customer satisfaction, better product quality, more reliable releases, improved productivity and efficiency, and the increased ability to build the right product by fast experimentation.[29]

The 2014 State of DevOps Report found that "IT performance strongly correlates with well-known DevOps practices such as the use of version control and continuous delivery."[13]

Criticism
There is a lack of evidence in academic literature on the effectiveness of DevOps.[e]

Cultural change
DevOps initiatives can create cultural changes in companies [41] by transforming the way operations, developers, and testers collaborate during the development and delivery processes.[2] Getting these groups to work cohesively is a critical challenge in enterprise DevOps adoption.[42][43] DevOps is as much about culture, as it is about the toolchain.[44]

DevOps as a job title
While DevOps describes an approach to work rather than a distinct role (like system administrator), job advertisements are increasingly using terms like "DevOps Engineer".[45][unreliable source?][46]

While DevOps reflects complex topics, the DevOps community uses analogies to communicate important concepts,[relevant? – discuss] much like "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" from the open-source community.[47]

10 deployments per day: the story of Flickr adopting DevOps.
Building a DevOps culture
Organizational culture is a strong predictor of IT and organizational performance. Cultural practices such as information flow, collaboration, shared responsibilities, learning from failures and new ideas are central to DevOps.[13] Team-building and other employee engagement activities are often used to create an environment that fosters this communication and cultural change within an organization.[49] Team-building activities can include board games, trust activities, and employee engagement seminars.[50][unreliable source?] DevOps as a service approach allows developers and operations teams to take greater control of their applications and infrastructure without hindering speed.

The 2015 State of DevOps Report discovered that the top seven measures with the strongest correlation to organizational culture are: 1. Organizational investment in DevOps:[14] 2. Team leaders' experience and effectiveness. 3. Continuous delivery. 4. The ability of different disciplines (development, operations, and infosec) to achieve win-win outcomes. 5. Organizational performance. 6. Deployment pain. 7. Lean management practices.

Modern DevOps engineers use Cloud Services in their work, such as Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, AliBaba, DigitalOcean, etc.[51] It allows simultaneous development and quick prototyping solutions without extra expenses.

Deployment

Companies with very frequent releases may require knowledge on DevOps.[citation needed] For example, the company that operates image hosting website Flickr developed a DevOps approach to support ten deployments a day.[52] Daily deployment cycles would be much higher at organizations producing multi-focus or multi-function applications.[citation needed] Daily deployment is referred to as continuous deployment[53][unreliable source?] or continuous delivery [54][unreliable source?] and has been associated with the lean startup methodology.[55][unreliable source?] Professional associations and blogs posts have formed on the topic since 2009.[56][unreliable source?][57][unreliable source?]

Architecturally significant requirements
To practice DevOps effectively, software applications have to meet a set of architecturally significant requirements (ASRs), such as: deployability, modifiability, testability, and monitorability.[58] These ASRs require a high priority and cannot be traded off lightly.

Microservices
Although in principle it is possible to practice DevOps with any architectural style, the microservices architectural style is becoming the standard for building continuously deployed systems.[30] Small size service allows the architecture of an individual service to emerge through continuous refactoring,[59] hence reducing the need for a big upfront design,[citation needed] allows for releasing the software early[citation needed] and continuously.

DevOps automation
DevOps automation can be achieved by repackaging platforms, systems, and applications into reusable building blocks[60] through the use of technologies such as virtual machines and containerization.[61][unreliable source?][62]

Implementation of DevOps automation in the IT-organization is heavily dependent on tools,[13][63][unreliable source?] which are required[citation needed] to cover different areas of the systems development lifecycle (SDLC):

Infrastructure as code
CI/CD
Test automation
Containerization
Orchestration
Software deployment
Software measurement
